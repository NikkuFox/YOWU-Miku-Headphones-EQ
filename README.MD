# YOWU Hatsune Miku Cat Ear Headphones EQ

The YOWU Miku headphones look great, but unfortunately sound a bit rubbish so I made an EQ for them.

I'm by no means an expert at this, but at least with my ears and headphones, this EQ makes them sound pretty good. I've only tested with the headphones in wired mode so this EQ may or may not work well with Bluetooth.

## "Miku peak filters" vs "Miku shelf filters"
"Miku shelf filters" is the smoother, better version of the EQ that I'd recommend using. I've included "Miku peak filters" as it is easier to modify and experiment with, but the peak filters make the frequency response graph a bit bumpy. The included graph images show this.

## Installation / Usage
The EQ is compatible with Equalizer APO on Windows with or without the Peace GUI.

### Equalizer APO
- Open `C:\Program Files\EqualizerAPO\config` and delete/rename `config.txt`
- Copy the EQ you want from the `Equalizer APO` folder to `C:\Program Files\EqualizerAPO\config` and rename it to `config.txt`
- Equalizer APO should load it automatically, or you may need to open the Configuration Editor

### Peace GUI
- Copy the EQ you want (or both) from the `Peace EQ` folder to `C:\Program Files\EqualizerAPO\config`
- Open Peace GUI and select the EQ configuration you want
